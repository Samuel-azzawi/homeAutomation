## Description and background of idea
we came out with the idea thinking of a more convenient way to control home appliances, such as lights, fans, etc. The concept involves creating an app or website for manual control, along with adding sensors for automatic operation. Additionally, a feature for scheduling when these appliances turn on or off can be integrated
